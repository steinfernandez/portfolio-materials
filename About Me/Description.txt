Hi. My name is Stein Astor Fernandez and I'm a game designer and programmer. My interests lie primarily in the field of game design, especially in balance and narrative. I'm currently in my second year at Rochester Institute of Technology, pursuing my MS in Game Design & Development. I am also currently seeking employment in the US or Canada for when I graduate in May.
