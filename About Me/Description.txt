Game Developer, Programmer


My name is Stein Astor Fernandez. My interests lie primarily in the field of game design, especially in balance and core mechanics. I'm currently in my second year at Rochester Institute of Technology, pursuing my MS in Game Design & Development. I am seeking employment in the US or Canada for when I graduate in May.
